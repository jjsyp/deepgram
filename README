Purpose:

Program designed to provide front end users, analysts, with a tool for benchmarking audio.  analysts will have the
capability to choose TTS models from a drop down, listen to audio from these models, provide feedback in the form of 
predetermined tags, set by admins with access to the proper database, and a 0-10 rating system.

These results are saved to a database to allow for efficient grouping and viewing of how these models are performing 
according to the analysts.


Inital Dev Note:
Following setup instructions allow for a functional progam using information saved locally.  Refer to the Future Development section
for notes on changes needed to incorporate other functionality.

Setup:

    Server:

    It is highly recommeded to create a python virtual enviroment before continuing to future steps.

    Naviagte to the the /server directory and enter the command "pip install -r requirements.txt" this will install all 
    necessary dependencies for the server.

    create a .env file within the server folder.  There already exists a txt file named "serverenv.txt" file within the server
    folder that contains a template and a description for all necessary env variables.

    To initialize the server, navigate to the server directy and execucate the file from the command line with the appropriate command.
    in orignal development this was "python3 server.py"

    Client:

    Requirements are listed in the package.json.
    simply run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

    Note that Node.js and npm must already be installed on your machine.   
    you can check this by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in your terminal.
    
        for instructions on installing Node.js on your machine visit https://nodejs.org/en/download
            Note that as of this writing, the latest version of Node.js also includes npm.
            more details on which npm version is includes with node.js can be found at https://nodejs.org/en/download
